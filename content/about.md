Hi, I'm Michael.

I started my B.Sc. in Computer Science at Technische Universität München (TUM) in 2013 and graduated in 2016 (B.Sc.) and 2019 (M.Sc.). 
From 2014 to 2016 I worked at research institute as research assistant and got my hands dirty with Android security and the development of a vulnerability scanner for Android applications. 
Since 2016 I'm doing penetration testing, social engineering, red teaming, physical security and lots of fun stuff for [HvS-Consulting](https://www.hvs-consulting.de/), an IT security consultancy located near Munich.
I'm a [Certified Red Team Operator (CRTO)](https://eu.badgr.com/public/assertions/dtEIp7atSV2lAHZ-e4DQJA?identity__email=eder@hvs-consulting.de) and generally like to hang out on conferences. Sometimes I also give talks.

My main interest is IT security, but I also write code from time to time - mainly Go, sometimes Python, but I'm profound in Java, too.  

Apart from spending time with computers, I like bouldering or experiencing adventures with my friends and colleagues.
At some point, I think it was a CCC congress a few years back, I discovered my fancy for doors and locks, so it is quite common to see me pulling out a bunch of weird tools when searching for my power plug at the bottom of my backpack.

As I said, I try to go to several conferences, mostly Europe based, each year. If you want to say "Hi" and have a beer or [Club Mate](https://www.club-mate.de/en/) with me, just get in touch! I'm usually there for meeting and making friends instead of talks I can also watch on Youtube 2 weeks later :-)

There's some German stuff on the site (especially older posts), but I'll try to write in English in the future.
