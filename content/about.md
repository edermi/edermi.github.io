I started my B.Sc. in Computer Science at Technische Universität München (TUM) in 2013 and graduated in 2016 (B.Sc.) and 2019 (M.Sc.). 
From 2014 to 2016 I worked at research institute as research assistant and got my hands dirty with Android security and the development of a vulnerability scanner for Android applications. 
Since 2016 I'm doing penetration testing, social engineering and lots of fun stuff for a small IT security consultancy located near Munich.

My main interest is IT security, but I also write code from time to time - mainly Go, sometimes Python, but I'm profound in Java, too.  

Apart from spending time with computers, I like bouldering or experiencing adventures with my friends and colleagues. 

I try to go to several conferences, mostly Europe based, each year. If you want to say "Hi" and have a beer or Mate with me, just get in contact ;)  

There's some German stuff on the site (especially older posts), but I'll try to write in English in the future.
